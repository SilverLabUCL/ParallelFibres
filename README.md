# ParallelFibres

## Summary
This repo contains code to data processing and analysis code for the following publication:

Lanore, F., Cayco-Gajic, N.A., Gurnani, H., Coyle, C., Silver, R.A. (2021). Cerebellar granule cell axons support high dimensional representations. Nature Neuroscience (accepted).
DOI: XXX

We used an AOL microscope to image granule cell axons in a 3D imaging volume in the cerebellar cortex of spontaneously behaving mice to examine how granule cell populations represent different behavioural states and sensorimotor variables. We also characterized the manifold structure and dimensionality of these representations. Please cite our paper above if you use this code in your research. 

## Structure

`ROI Grouping/` contains scripts and functions for processing data and grouping varicosities into putative axons.

`Analysis/` contains scripts and functions for analysing bidirectionality, spatial correlations, manifold structure, and dimensionality.

## Additional Information
Processed data can be found at (Figshare link). Raw data available upon request due to size. For any questions, contact [Alex Cayco Gajic](https://sites.google.com/view/caycogajic/home).
